# Change Log

## 1.1.0 - 2016-02-12

### Changed
- "Show in position" was a confusing setting, so it was switched with "Show as a
  system message". By default the messages are now displayed in their defined
  position as normal modules, *not* by using the application message queue.
- Class name was changed from "alert-smr-motd" to "smr-motd smr-motd--{type}",
  in addition to the default classes.
- The default heading level was changed from 3 to 4 (used by the Isis template).

### Added
- "None" to the message types in case the message needs to be displayed without
  styling.
- Class "smr-motd__heading smr-motd__heading--{type}" to the heading, just in
  case.
- A div with the class "smr-motd__body smr-motd__body--{type}" was added around
  the actual message text.
- An option to hide the message heading separate from the title generated by
  the template chrome. This prevents unwanted double headings, if you want to
  display the chrome heading.
